## Amazon RDS
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in AWS. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating or outsourcing time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.

## RDS dbs:
MySQL Server, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Aurora,  SQL Server, Oracle

## Amazon Aurora 
Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of traditional enterprise databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases.

Amazon Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 128TB per database instance. It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).

## Amazon Redshift
Amazon Redshiftis a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. The Redshift service manages all of the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse. These tasks include provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine.

## Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multiregion, multimaster, durable non-SQL database. It comes with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.

The main components of DynamoDB are:
-	a collection which serves as the foundational table
-	a document which is equivalent to a row in a SQL database
-	key-value pairs which are the fields within the document or row
