# AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open source tool which allows for a high level of abstraction to be achieved through using a familiar programming language to **define, build, deploy and package cloud infrastructure**.

CDK is a software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation.

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up (provision) your Amazon Web Services resources.  

AWS CloudFormation enables you to:

- Create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly.

- Leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling.

- Build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.

- Use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit (a stack).

Use the AWS CDK to define your cloud resources in a familiar programming language. The AWS CDK supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#/.Net and GO (in developer preview).

Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components known as Constructs. You compose these together into Stacks and Apps.
