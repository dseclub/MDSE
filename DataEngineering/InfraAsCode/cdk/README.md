# AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

CDK is a software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation.

AWS CloudFormation enables you to:

- Create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly.

- Leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling.

- Build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.

- Use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit (a stack).

Use the AWS CDK to define your cloud resources in a familiar programming language. The AWS CDK supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#/.Net.

Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components known as Constructs. You compose these together into Stacks and Apps.
