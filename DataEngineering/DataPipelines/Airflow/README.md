# Airflow


Apache Airflow is an open source project written in Python for programmatically author, schedule and monitor batch execution of tasks.

You can design your pipelines according to a determined logic: decide which actions to perform, retry them if errors occur, skip tasks if dependencies are not met, access monitor and log status through a friendly and powerful web UI, and a lot more.
