## DBT Semantic Layer

The Semantic Layer is made up of a combination of open-source and SaaS offerings and is going to change how your team defines and consumes metrics.

the dbt Semantic Layer enables organizations to centrally define business metrics in dbt and then query them from any analytics tool, ensuring that critical definitions such as 'revenue,' 'customer count,' or 'churn rate' are consistent in every data application the organization is using. 14 partner integrations were also announced at the keynote, including integrations developed by Atlan, Deepnote, Hex, Mode, Thoughtspot.



The dbt Semantic Layer will provide benefits:

Consistency and precision on business-critical metrics across the organization

Better self-serve experiences for business users, who will be able to discover and pick from a list of trusted and maintained metrics in downstream tools

Easier change propagation, making it possible to make changes to metric definitions centrally and have them be quickly reflected in downstream tools

Tool flexibility, enabling everyone in an organization to use their preferred analytics tooling, with confidence that metrics are the same in each
