Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a database service that is purpose-built for JSON data management at scale, fully managed and integrated with AWS, and enterprise-ready with high durability.

Amazon DocumentDB is designed from the ground-up to give you the scalability and durability you need when operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads. In Amazon DocumentDB, storage scales automatically up to 64TiB without any impact to your application. It supports millions of requests per second with up to 15 low latency read replicas in minutes, without any application downtime, regardless of the size of your data.

Amazon DocumentDB is designed for 99.99% availability and replicates six copies of your data across three AWS Availability Zones (AZs). You can use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for free (for six months) to easily migrate your self-managed MongoDB databases to Amazon DocumentDB with virtually no downtime.
