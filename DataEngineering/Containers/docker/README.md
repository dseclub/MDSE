  A Docker image is essentially a snapshot of a Docker container and a container is a running instance of an image.

  A Docker image is the blueprint for the mini computer-within-a-computer that Docker will provide us. The Docker organization has a website called Docker Hub which allows people to distribute their own Docker images. In this case weâ€™re about to get an Ubuntu image from the official Ubuntu page on Docker Hub.

  A Docker container is mini computer actively running in your computer. Each container starts off as a live, running instance of a Docker image.


  To create a Docker container, we will use a Docker image, and to build a Docker image, we will use a Dockerfile.
  An image is made up of a set of layers and each instruction in a Dockerfile adds a layer to the image.
