## Testing with Pytest

Pytest is a testing framework based on python. It is mainly used to write API test cases.

**Fixtures** for handling test dependencies, state, and reusable functionality
**Marks** for categorizing tests and limiting access to external resources
**Parametrization** for reducing duplicated code between tests
**Durations** to identify your slowest tests
**Plugins** for integrating with other frameworks and testing tools
