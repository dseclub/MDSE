NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

It contains among other things:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

Gradient Decent is a popular optimization techniques. It uses to optimize or improve accuracy of our model prediction.

Gradient Decent for Nearal Nets is called Backpropagation.
