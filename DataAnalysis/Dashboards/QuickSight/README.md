 # Amazon QuickSight

[Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.

QuickSight lets you easily create and publish interactive BI dashboards that include Machine Learning-powered insights.

QuickSight dashboards can be accessed from any device, and seamlessly embedded into your applications, portals, and websites.

QuickSight is serverless and can automatically scale to tens of thousands of users without any infrastructure to manage or capacity to plan for.

It is also the first BI service to offer pay-per-session pricing, where you only pay when your users access their dashboards or reports, making it cost-effective for large scale deployments.
